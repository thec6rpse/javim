 # Javim
To understand the difference between these two different files you have to install the latest released version of java and JDK (Java Development Kit). 

When you create your java program using
```nvim Example.java```

You'll need a compiler for your terminal to read it. In a nutshell a compiler is like the reason people learn languages like ASL. It's like training a Dragon to be friendly with your village and understand patterns. It'll translates ```.java``` file to another programming language. In this case will be a filename extension that contains executable Java bytecode, a called ```.class``` file.
As always I'd recommend you to install it in your preferable terminal. 
You have to get used with CLI and avoid other simplistic environments. You'll become a power user doing that way.

Type ```javac Example.java``` to compile your java program.
And then type ```java Example``` to run it.
